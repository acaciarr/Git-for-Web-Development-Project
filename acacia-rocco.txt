Task 3: Stretch
Stretch Review questions: 
    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?

     inline elements do not force a new line to begin, block elements cause a line break to occur

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 

      the element will stay in that exact spot no matter if you scroll

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 

      flex grow?

    4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default

      display block: <div>, <h1>-<h6>, <p>
      display inline: <span>, <a>
      display inline-block: <img>

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 

      The box model is the set of rules that decides how a CSS elementâ€™s sizes are computed as you add padding, borders, and margins around the content. The fix is box-sizing: border-box

Stretch Git Tasks
- [x] While the processes learned here will set you up to be successful in most situations, they are just the tip of the iceberg in learning Git. Independently research the following topics to learn more about Git.
  - [x] Research and understand what a `merge conflict` is and how to resolve it.
  - [x] Research the Git commands `pull`, `rebase`, `merge`. These commands will allow you to bring in changes that other developers push to the main branch.
  - [x] Research the Git commands `reset `, `revert`, `clean`. These commands will allow you to go back and amends previous commits you have made.

- [x] Research and set up a Graphical User Interface (GUI) Git console. 

- [x] Research and setup SSH keys with GitHub, so that you do not need to input your username/password each time you push.
